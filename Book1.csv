"while the pandemic has led to people and authorities shifting their focus on fighting the coronavirus some technology companies are trying to use this situation as a pretext to push unproven artificial intelligence ai tools into workplaces and schools according to a report in the journal nature amid a serious debate over the potential for misuse of these technologies several emotionreading tools are being marketed for remote surveillance of children and workers to predict their emotions and performance these tools can capture emotions in real time and help organisations and schools with a much better understanding of their employees and students respectively us officials rushed to defend amazons business practices in india after reuters reported in february that the company had favoured certain sellers on its website and bypassed local law that requires foreign ecommerce companies to treat all vendors equally documents obtained by the news agency show emails obtained through the us freedom of information act from the office of the united states trade representative ustr showed that us officials prepared a note for john kerry a top envoy of president joe biden about the feb reuters report the note contained in an email dated feb said that indias antitrust watchdog had reviewed many such allegations against us ecommerce companies and found nothing wrong bidens envoy former us secretary of state kerry is in charge of climate change policy he was scheduled to speak that day with indias commerce minister piyush goyal the us government was concerned that goyal would bring up the reuters story so it hastily drafted a note about the article in case he did the emails show the us embassy in new delhi referred questions to the us department of state in washington which said it expected that any issues regarding us ecommerce companies practices in india would be reviewed by the competition commission of india cci with the same level of independence transparency and professionalism it has demonstrated in the past spokespeople for kerry the ustr and goyal did not respond to reuters queries what little is known about andrew burds early life is contained in a slim child protective services case file that chronicles the boys descent into the child welfare system his mother was just sixteen the file shows when she gave birth to him in corpus christi on july she would later admit according to one report to using alcohol methamphetamines cocaine and crack cocaine lsd marijuana cigarettes and taking prescription xanax his father was seventeen and worked for a traveling carnival cps launched its initial investigation into andrews wellbeing shortly after his first birthday when his mother took him to a local hospital with a broken arm four subsequent investigations were triggered by reports of abuse or neglect including one allegation that both his mother and maternal grandmother were incapable of properly caring for him because they used methamphetamines when andrew was twoandahalf years old cps determined that he was in immediate danger according to an affidavit and he was put in foster care his mothers and fathers parental rights were terminated soon after he turned three if not for a corpus christi couple named larry and hannah overton andrew might have lingered in state custody shuffled from one foster home to another the overtons already had four children and larrys incomehe installed landscape lightingwas barely enough to make ends meet but as devoted christians their desire to adopt a foster child was rooted in faith more than in practicality both larry and hannah had done missionary work and as a teenager hannah had spent holidays volunteering at an orphanage across the border in reynosa where she had fed bathed and ministered to kids who had been living on the streets the experience had affected her deeply and she told larry that she was willing to adopt a child with disabilities or an older child who had been unable to find a permanent home as a former privateduty nurse hannah felt equipped to handle the challenges of a foster child she had spent several years caring for specialneeds children some of whom were profoundly disabled in the overtons began to pursue the idea seriously they considered adopting a nineyearold girl who was deaf but when after much prayer and deliberation they decided to move forward with the adoption they learned that the girl had been placed with another family not long afterward larry and hannah heard about andrew at their church calvary chapel of the coastlands which andrews foster mother also attended the nondenominational church on the south side of corpus christi drew many young evangelicals with its emphasis on a versebyverse understanding of the bible and larry and hannah were wellregarded members larry taught sunday school hannah led a bible study and their children whom hannah homeschooled attended youth group and socialized with other members kids andrew accompanied his foster mother to services every sunday and with his thatch of blond hair and beaming grin he was hard to miss he had a speech delay and spoke haltingly sometimes with a stutter but every week when his sunday school classmates went around in a circle to say their prayer requests he made the same wish aloud that he would be adopted the overtons daughters fouryearold isabel and threeyearold ally reported back to their parents that the new boy in their class needed a family can andrew be our brother the girls pleaded a church elder who was himself an adoptive parent invited the overtons to dinner one night and encouraged them to consider bringing andrew into their home andrews foster mother who had provided refuge to roughly three hundred children over three decades was also supportive but others at calvary chapel expressed their concern the churchs pastor rod carver and his wife noreen had initially considered taking in andrew but ultimately decided he was more than they could handle more outspoken was andrews sunday school teacher who sat hannah and larry down and told them that he was a troubled kid he hoarded food and sometimes ate from the trash she warned and he threw intense temper tantrums which could be tamed only by holding and rocking him on several occasions his fits had grown so extreme that she had resorted to asking a male parishioner to physically remove him from the classroom until he could regain selfcontrol think of your other children she urged the couple its been a year long enough for the events to be flattened and foreshortened long enough for the authorities to paint their account over the true one last months statements by nancy pelosi et al exposed the hope that a guilty verdict for chauvin will be enough to end this episode sating the popular fury and killing the memory of the rebellion we shall see even now an official narrative has yet to emerge from the chaos of last spring but it was stunning to watch the corporate media try to summon one and fail confounded by the images they flashed in the publics face at the dnc last fall we saw how the uprising may be remembered a sunny noble blur of soaring rhetoric and peaceful crowdsa fabulous alternative to the rawness on the ground but certain facts remain some things cant be wished away too much was born and broken amid the smoke and screams the least we can do is rememberto try after the riots after the speeches after the backlash and elections and after this latest livestreamed liturgy of american criminal justice to recall what really happened extracting and reconstructing the whole flabbergasting sequence last year something massive came hurtling into view and exploded against the surface of daily life in the us many are still struggling to grasp what that thing was its shape and implications its sudden scale and bitter limits one thing we know for sure is that it opened with a riot on the street in minneapolis where floyd had cried out i cant breathe to hear them repeated six years later by another black man slain on camera by police lent the instant rage and hurt a humiliated futility the dream of black lives matter now seemed shredded by events michael brown in ferguson freddie gray in baltimorethe murders of these young black men launched explosive local uprisings which were followed but never matched by demonstrations across the country those were marches not rebellions large and passionate but a degree removed for the first few days, it seemed that minneapolis would follow suit a riot in a single city to be met with the old routine lament the stubborn tensions that wrack this complex countrythen try to pin the violence on notorious outside agitators videos had already surfaced of white militants smashing glass there were other videos of coursethe ransacked lake street target brute assaults by the police clouds of tear gas blotting out entire city blocksthat revealed the robust presence of black people in the street but fantasy proved irresistible was this a plot by anarchists or the radical rightwing fringe tim walz the minnesota governor announced that per cent of the rioters had arrived from out of town no matter that this was a total falsehood to be rescinded the following day in high authoritarian style the rumors rhymed felicitously with the song sung by the state the event felt like a fulcrum the whole country seemed to tilt sacked shopping malls in los angeles and pillaged luxury outlets in atlanta a siege on new yorks soho and flaming vehicles from coast to coast pictures of philadelphia and washington dc showed whole neighborhoods bristling with insurgency crowds smashed the lordly windows in chicagos loop and rioters set fire to the market house where slaves were bought and sold in fayetteville north carolina the town where floyd was born not all of this surely could be the work of agents provocateurs something deeper and more disruptive had breached the surface of social life conjuring exactly the dreaded image the conspiracy theorists refused to face this was open black revolt simultaneous but uncoordinated a vivid fixture of american history sprung to life with startling speed a thousand seven hundred us towns and citiesthe number was absurd within a week national guardsmen were dispatched to support city forces as they lurched to regain control but what emerged under the banner of blackness was soon blended with other elements flinging multiracial crowds against soldiers and police in living memory this breadth and volume were virtually unprecedented apart from the national uprisings sparked by the murder of martin luther king jra name wheeled out on cue to bemoan the unruliness of the rebellion kings nonviolent protest was the fruit of a rigorous spiritual disciplineas well as a tactic deployed pragmatically before a scrim of mounting chaos this was a theory of direct action tension and confrontation were fundamental to the task by applying unremitting pressure to every facet of civic life he wished as he wrote in letter from birmingham jail to foment a situation so crisispacked that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation the backdrop to that negotiation was the black rage breaking out in cities across the country armed resistance groups formed in black enclaves in the north and west here was another crisispacked possibility so some of the states concessions to the baptist reverend may have been clinched by the urban rebels and by the late s as kings vision swept beyond mere equality before the law he came to see revolt as a simple fact of his political moment nothing to relish or openly cultivateor bombastically decry the constructive achievement of the decade to deceived us he wrote everyone underestimated the amount of violence and rage negroes were suppressing and the vast amount of bigotry the white majority was disguising they were vigorously disabused of this as peaceful crowds were bashed gassed cuffed maced kettled for hours and driven into by police vanson may alone eight people were left partially blind from rubber bullets on the first night of the new york rebellion i was nearly struck by an nypd vehicle barreling down a crowded street the driver came out and howled at us before bursting into tears the next week i was arrested at the most orderly demonstration i saw all springnot a single broken window after less than an hour of marching through the south bronx we were choked on all sides by officers who kept us in place until the emergency curfew fell then came the attack cordons of police pressed hard on either side of the trapped crowd and began to wallop anything that movedmany officers clambered onto parked cars to swing truncheons at our skulls my friend had worn his bicycle helmet which within minutes was shattered in half the marchers were picked out from the crowd one by one as the police beat their way through the screaming kettle two officers grabbed my arms and slammed me to the tarmac a third knelt on my spine and bound my wrists in plastic cuffs i stayed in that position arms twisted behind my back for eight of the seventeen hours i spent in police custody but from the chaos of that night one thing burns brightest in my memory the hush that fell over the crowded cell as the gate swung open for a young white man like us he was still in cuffs but hed been beaten worse than anyone else his head cracked so hard that his red hair was plastered to his skull and his small face blackened with dried blood with his arms pinned behind his back he looked like a bird in an oil spill when i complained about my wet boots during the winters growing up in maine he told me stories about running barefoot in the snow in korea to harden his feet for tae kwon do his answer to many of my childhood complaints was usually that i had to be tougher stronger prepared for any attack or disaster the lesson his generation took from those they lost to the korean war was that death was always close and i know now that he was doing all he could to teach me to protect myself when i cried at the beach at the waters edge afraid of the waves he threw me in no son of mine is going to be afraid of the ocean he said when i first started swimming lessons he told me i had to be a strong swimmer in case the boat i was on went down so i could swim to shore when he taught me to bodysurf he taught me about how to know the approach of an undertow and how to survive a riptide when i lacked a competitive streak he took to racing me at something i lovedswimming underwater while holding my breath i was an asthmatic child but soon intent on beating him i could swim yards this way at a time but beyond the little joys and sorrows you take away from here there is a huge responsibility on each one of you to pay back to the society and country which have contributed to your education and success so far some of you would be joining job responsibilities while others may pursue higher studies the stage of life in which you find yourself today is usually full of dreams and aspirations on the one hand and uncertainties and apprehensions on the other this is also the time to make major life decisions starting a new job pursuing your dreams supporting your family or starting a new one while doing all this i urge you all to introspect what are the values and principles you stand for what is the kind of career you want to pursue by far, the most important point of introspection is what kind of person you want to become however it has been observed that the enrolment of women in technical and scientific disciplines is low according to a recent survey enrollment of women in engineering and technical institutes across india is only about per cent our girls should be encouraged to pursue technical education and excel in the same manner as they do in other areas the country needs more of our girls to pursue higher education especially in science technology engineering and mathematics the growth and excellence of women in technical areas will add a new dimension to our national development it will promote gender empowerment at higher levels in the field of science and technology it will help women break the glassceiling in one of the most important spheres in the world of st century friends twelve months ago a new programme of total mobilization or maximum sacrifice was placed before indians in east asia today i shall give you an account of our achievements during the past year and shall place before you our demands for the coming year but before i do so i want you to realize once again what a golden opportunity we have for winning freedom the british are engaged in a worldwide struggle and in the course of this struggle they have suffered defeat after defeat on so many fronts the enemy having been thus considerably weakened our fight for liberty has become very much easier than it was five years ago such a rare and godgiven opportunity comes once in a century that is why we have sworn to fully utilize this opportunity for liberating our motherland from the british yoke the first requisite for building a strong free india is unity and peace if there is no unity in the country it is bound to go down therefore we must first of all adjust our differences and behave in such a manner that there is complete harmony and peace in the country you cannot expect the government continues to maintain peace by force it would be an evil day when in this country the government has to use repressive measures permanently today we are passing through a period of crisis, and our young men have in their impatience not realised that the freedom which has been obtained with great difficulty is likely to be lost or likely to give no benefit no advantage if we do not appreciate that our present duty is to unite and consolidate our freedom there is one other thing that we have to do to maintain peace and order in this country for a few years at least till we can stand on our own legs we must forget that we can now and then threaten the government we cannot function if the government is to be challenged day after day by groups of people who want to have their own way what they want may be according to their own honest thinking very good but gandhiji has put before us the ideal of obtaining what we want by peaceful methods and through truth and nonviolence if people begin to threaten and challenge governments authority and try to overthrow it to gain their objectives by force the latter would not be able to do anything constructive forces exist in this country which would create chaos and disorder which would weaken the country instead of strengthening it we must all understand that partition is behind us it has to come to stay i honestly believe that it is good for both the new nations to be rid of a perpetual source of trouble and quarrels in two hundred years of slavery the administration created a situation in which we began to drift away from each other it is good that we have agreed to partition despite all its evils i have never repented my agreeing to partition from the experience of one year of joint administration when we have not agreed to partition i know we would have erred grievously and repented if we had not agreed it would have resulted in a partition not into two countries but several bits therefore whatever some people may say i am convinced and i remain convinced that our having agreed to partition has been for the good of the country"
